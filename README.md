# GetTauMax

Program to calculate tauMax, the collisional lifetime of the largest bodies at a certain location in a debris disc, based on the model of Lohne2008. By default the code uses the assumptions in Pearce2023 (submitted) for various relations and parameters, for example the critical fragmentation energy QD*, but these can be changed.

To use the code, simply set your desired parameters in the 'User Inputs' section below, then run the code. This will print out tauMax, as well as some intermediate calculations. Unless you want to change anything more major like the QD* function, nothing below the User Inputs section needs changing.

Feel free to use this code, and if the results go into a publication, then please cite Lohne et al. 2008 and Pearce et al. 2023 (submitted). Also, please let me know if you find any bugs or have any requests.
